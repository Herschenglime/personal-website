  <h2>Binary Trees</h2>
  <p>I also learned a bit about working with binary trees in discrete math, but as far as I can recall, I don't think they've come up in my coding classes. Therefore, below is an attempt at a binary tree implementation from memory and some helper functions, formatted as a JS class.</p>
